Some body might think that we can find min and max number from the array so that we can get the max profit. But here is one catch
For Example:
prices=[3,4,1,6]
min=1
max=6
profit=max-min=5 which is correct 
in this Example:
prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
min = 1 price at day 6
max = 7 price at day 1
max_profit = 7-1 = 6 u can think like this but you can buy the stock at day 6 and sell it at day 1.

So what is the best way to  find the max profit lets see ðŸ˜ƒ
- Explanation:
```
let use initialize Left and Right pointer to first and second position of array
Here Left is to buy stock and Right is to sell stock

    Then we initialize our max_profit as 0

    Now we will start our while loop and we will run till our Right pointer less then length of array
    For Example:

    prices=[7,1,5,3,6,4]
```
Note:
    prices[left] --> buy stock
    prices[right] --> sell stock
now we will check price at right and left pointer

- step 1:
price[left]=7 price[right]=1 profit=-6
here price[left] is greater than price[right] so we will move left pointer to the right position and increment our right pointer by 1. 
We always want our left point to be minimum
- step 2:
price[left]=1 price[right]=5 profit=4
here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone
- step 3:
price[left]=1 price[right]=3 profit=2
here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will check our max_profit previously it was 4 
now our current profit is 2 so we will check which is maximum and update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone
- step 4:
price[left]=1 price[right]=6 profit=5
here price[left] is less than price[right] which means we will get profit so we will check our max_profit previously it was 4 
now our current profit is 5 so we will check which is maximum and update our max_profit and move our right pointer alone
- step 5:
price[left]=1 price[right]=4 profit=3
same logic as above
```
	Big O :
n--> length of array
Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
```

lets go to the solution:

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self,prices):
        left = 0 #Buy
        right = 1 #Sell
        max_profit = 0
        while right < len(prices):
            currentProfit = prices[right] - prices[left] #our current Profit
            if prices[left] < prices[right]:
                max_profit =max(currentProfit,max_profit)
            else:
                left = right
            right += 1
        return max_profit
```
