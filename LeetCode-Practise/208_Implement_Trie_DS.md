Implementation:

A trie (pronounced as "try") or prefix tree is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spellchecker.

Implement the Trie class:

- Trie() Initializes the trie object.
- `void insert(String word)` Inserts the string word into the trie.
- `boolean search(String word)` Returns true if the string word is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
- `boolean startsWith(String prefix)` Returns true if there is a previously inserted string word that has the prefix prefix, and false otherwise.


Code:
```
class Trie:

    def __init__(self):
        self.trie = {}
        

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        t = self.trie
        for c in word:
            if c not in t:
                t[c] = {}
            t = t[c]
        t['-'] = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        t = self.trie
        for c in word:
            if c not in t:
                return False
            t = t[c]
        return "-" in t

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        t = self.trie
        for c in prefix:
            if c  not in t:
                return False
            t = t[c]
        return True


# Your Trie object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = Trie()
# obj.insert(word)
# param_2 = obj.search(word)
# param_3 = obj.startsWith(prefix)
```
